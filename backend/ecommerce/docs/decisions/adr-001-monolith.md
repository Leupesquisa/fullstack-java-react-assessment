# ADR-001: Modular Monolith Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When designing the e-commerce application, we needed to decide on an architectural approach that would balance development speed, operational simplicity, and future scalability. The main options considered were:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Separate services for products, orders, users, etc.
2. **Traditional Monolith**: Single codebase with tightly coupled components
3. **Modular Monolith**: Single deployable unit with clear internal boundaries

We needed to consider factors such as:
- Team size and experience
- Development velocity
- Operational complexity
- Future scalability requirements
- Domain complexity

## Decision

We have decided to implement the e-commerce application as a **Modular Monolith** using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

The application will be structured as follows:
- Clear bounded contexts (product, auth, cart, order, admin, event)
- Each bounded context has its own domain model, services, and repositories
- Shared kernel for cross-cutting concerns
- Well-defined interfaces between bounded contexts
- Single database with schema separation

## Rationale

### Advantages of the Modular Monolith approach:

1. **Reduced Operational Complexity**:
   - Single deployment unit
   - Simplified monitoring and logging
   - No distributed system complexities (network partitions, eventual consistency)

2. **Development Velocity**:
   - Easier local development setup
   - No need for complex service discovery or API gateway
   - Simplified testing (fewer integration points)

3. **Clear Boundaries with Migration Path**:
   - DDD bounded contexts provide clear separation of concerns
   - Well-defined interfaces between modules
   - Future migration to microservices is possible if needed

4. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Lower infrastructure costs
   - Reduced memory footprint
   - Simplified CI/CD pipeline

### Why not Microservices?

While microservices offer benefits like independent scaling and deployment, they introduce significant complexity:
- Distributed system challenges
- Service discovery and orchestration
- Data consistency across services
- Operational overhead
- More complex testing

For our current team size and project requirements, the operational and development overhead of microservices would outweigh the benefits.

### Why not a Traditional Monolith?

A traditional monolith without clear internal boundaries would:
- Become difficult to maintain as the codebase grows
- Make it harder to understand the system
- Lead to tight coupling between unrelated components
- Make future refactoring more difficult

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster initial development
- Simplified deployment and operations
- Clear code organization
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Lower infrastructure costs

### Negative

- Limited independent scaling of components
- Potential for larger deployment units over time
- Risk of boundaries being violated if not enforced
- Database schema changes affect the entire application

### Mitigations

- Enforce module boundaries through package structure and architecture tests
- Use schema separation in the database
- Implement proper error isolation between modules
- Design with future extraction to microservices in mind if needed

## Future Considerations

If specific bounded contexts need independent scaling or deployment in the future, we can extract them into separate services. The clear boundaries established in the modular monolith will make this transition easier.

We will revisit this decision if:
- The team size grows significantly
- Deployment frequency becomes a bottleneck
- Specific modules need independent scaling
- The codebase becomes too large to manage effectively
